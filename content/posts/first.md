I've been blogging on and off since 1999. I started because a girl I liked
introduced me to Diaryland, and I wanted to impress her so I started writing
there, too. I've written while living in a couple of different countries,
through marriage and kids, and about everything from learning Chinese to writing
software. I've had a really hard time staying consistent with it, as many people
who have followed me online over the last few decades know, but there's always
next time, right? :-)

This time I've created a blog using Hugo, a fairly complex static site generator
written in Go and meant for really much more complicated productions than this
one will ever be. I feel like that's a good thing, so that if this really does
grow into something bigger I won't have to change platforms, but at the same
time it has required a level of fiddling that I honestly had no intention of
devoting when I started this project. All that said, though, it works and I'm
happy with it.

I hope you like it, too.
